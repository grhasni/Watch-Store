          We are glad to present the new Lawson Assortment. These are three
          quartz models planned considering effortlessness and style kept. They
          come in various sizes and tones, and all component a tempered steel
          back â€” leaving sufficient room for a customized etching. The etching
          administration is free with any watch from the Lawson series.
